###Overview

Welcome to **"A Ventleman's Adventure"**, a game that tests luck and good judgment with every keystroke. The game itself is an adventure RPG (role-playing game) where the user plays as "Alyx," an ex-mercenary merchant based in the realm of "Orylia" who is attempting to reach the castle to seek counsel with the Emperor. However, on his quest, he faces significant hardships, ranging from soldiers to dragons to even assassins! Interested?
